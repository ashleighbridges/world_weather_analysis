# world_weather_analysis

## Project Description
This project was completed as part of development for the PlanMyTrip app. In this project, I generated a list of 2,000 random cities, used APIs to find the current weather information for each city as well as the nearest hotel, and utilized Google Maps to create a sample vacation itinerary based on criteria a client would set for their ideal vacation.
